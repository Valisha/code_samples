# for each set of occurrences in file3, we have either 3 ORFs occuring to one another of 4. Thus, for first chance of the ORFs bring side by side is 3/5800 (3 being the number of ORFs that occur together and 5800 being the total number of genes present in yeast) for the next gene near to the first gene and that one being near to its homologue, is given by 3/5800*3/5800 because we are studying the occurence of all these ORFs together on the same gene. And for the 4 ORFs we do 4/5800*4/5800*4/5800 for the reasons stated above. The value for 3 chances and 4 chances are extremely different and have a huge difference, which is because as the number of ORFs keep on increasing it becomes more and more rare that the homologues occur on the same gene. for example P(S) = x and P(T) = y. If both of these probabilites are exclusive and do not depend on one another then the resultant probability is given by P(S)*P(T) there for as the number of "near" ORFs increase its probability for occuring together likewise decreases. On the account as to why we see more probability than these expected numbers is because of one virtue, which is recombiantion. ORFs of these orders occur more than usual because they do not get distributed during recombination as much as the other genes do, because they are placed close to one another and recombination is inversely proportional to the distances between two genes, these genes then due to evolution start occurring together and because of these reasons we find higher probability than expeced.
