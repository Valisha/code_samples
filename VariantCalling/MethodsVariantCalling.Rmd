# Variant Calling
## Methods 
*  getGenome.sh
getGenome uses "wget" command to retrieve reference genome from an online database 
*  getReads.sh
getReads uses fastq-dump to get the NGS reads used in the comparison paper 
* trimReads.sh
trimReads uses trimmomatic a java program to trim the leading, trailing and also returns the paried and unpaired sequences from the reads that are downloaded
* indexGenome.sh
indexGenome uses bwa (burrows-wheeler algorithm) to index the genome 
* alignReads.sh 
alignReads aligns the reads using bwa-mem again from the bwa program to get the aligned reads from the reference genome and the fastq files
* analyzeVariants.sh
producing a VCF file using DeepVariant
